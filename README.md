# Job Search Mobile App

## Project Overview
I developed a mobile application that simulates a job search platform. This project showcases my skills in React Native development, focusing on state management, component creation, and UI design implementation.

## Key Features

### Login Screen
- Implemented a login screen that captures user's name and email
- On login, the app passes user data to the home screen

### Home Screen
- Displays the user's name and email received from the login screen
- Features two main sections: Popular Jobs and Featured Jobs

### Job Cards
- Designed and implemented a reusable functional component for job cards
- The component accepts props to display various job details
- Created at least 8 different cards for each section (Popular and Featured Jobs)

### UI Design
- Styled the application to closely match a provided UI design
- Focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface

### Custom Components
- Utilized custom components throughout the application for consistency and reusability

## Technical Highlights
- Developed using React Native, demonstrating proficiency in mobile app development
- Implemented state management to pass data between screens
- Created reusable functional components, showcasing component-based architecture skills
- Applied styling techniques to achieve a polished, professional look

## Learning Outcomes
This project enhanced my understanding of:
- React Native component lifecycle and state management
- Passing data between different screens in a mobile app
- Creating and styling reusable components
- Implementing design specifications in a mobile application

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with a backend API for real job data
- Implement user authentication
- Add job search and filtering capabilities
- Introduce a job application feature

This job search app represents a significant step in my mobile development journey, demonstrating my ability to create feature-rich, visually appealing mobile applications with a focus on user experience and modern development practices.
